Data Mining Techniques
There are over one million restaurants in the United States[1]. Over 200 million U.S. customers visited a sit-down restaurant every year. 90% of guests research a restaurant online before dining which is more than any other business type[2]. Among those, most people judge a restaurant in one second by looking at the ratings. In this paper, we build four different classifiers to classify one restaurant to high star or low star according to its existing attributes.

In this project, we plan to collect about 10 GB data from the Yelp public dataset which is a subset of Yelp’s businesses, reviews, and user data. We will keep the information about restaurants and remove the rest of the businesses. From these data, we want to extract the restaurant attributes like price, good for kids, parking space and so on. Besides the specific attributes of each restaurant, we will finally determine the star of each restaurant according to these attributes. This will definitely be a useful guide for future businesses to understand people’s demands.

We will load the user review data and apply text mining techniques to determine the stars (high or low) of each restaurant. We plan to extract the basic attributes and according to these features, we will use Naïve Bayes, KNN, linear regression and SVM classifiers to classify each restaurant to high star or low star.
